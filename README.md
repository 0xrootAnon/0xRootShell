# 0xRootShell

Minimalist, cinematic terminal for windows.

## Quick run (dev on Linux)

1. Ensure Go is installed (1.20+ recommended).
2. Clone project and `cd 0xRootShell`.
3. Fetch modules:
```bash
   go mod tidy
```
4. Run locally (Linux terminal):
```bash
go run ./cmd/rootsh
```

Note: The UI uses Bubble Tea and opens in the current terminal. 
The ASCII splash displays at top.
   
>>Every command should be readable like a sentence, powerful like a root script, and cinematic like a hacker movie
