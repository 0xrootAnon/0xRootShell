Plugins are out-of-scope for the first MVP. This folder will house:
- JSON/YAML manifest files that declare commands
- A plugin host that spawns plugin executables and communicates via JSON-RPC

For now this file is a placeholder. Add plugin code later as separate Go binaries that implement the plugin protocol.
